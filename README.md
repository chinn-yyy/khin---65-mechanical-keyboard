# khin---65-mechanical-keyboard
This keyboard was designed for productivity for the Blueprint club ran by HackClub. It features a 66 key layout with 2 programmable macro keys. I chose the DUROCK Ice King switches for this project. Not only do they sound amazing, they also match my vibe; transparent. Additionally, I decided to use the GATREON screw in stabilizers that are also, you guessed it, transparent! 

My keyboard isn't just a keyboard with keys. It also features a big, bright, 0.91 inch OLED display that can display the last key you pressed, a fun animation, etc. Not only does it have an OLED it also has 68 addressable LED's. One for each key. These can be any color and any pattern.

On the firmware side of things, my keyboard is being ran by QMK open source firmware on a Raspberry Pi Pico. QMK is specifically designed for keyboards, not only is it easy to use but it also has tons of features. 


Make sure to look at my Blueprint page to see the journal and the process it took to build this. Here is the link: https://blueprint.hackclub.com/projects/11738
